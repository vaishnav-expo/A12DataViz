<h2>What is Black hat chart?</h2>
<p>
    Black Hat Visualization is the blanket term we use to describe all of the actions that malicious visualization designers can take to meet their goals. Creating out- right “lying” visualizations is just one small category in this larger space of bad behavior. The below question provides example of how the visualization can be Black Hat.
</p>
<h2>Why it is Black hat chart?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>It tells only population in the title which makes it ambiguous whether it is total population,percentage,mean or etc? Whose population it is? Which years's population is considered?</li>
    <li>It intentionally uses misleading colours which makes it hard to compare for users.(Bad/wrong colour scale is used)</li>
    <li>It doesn't mention the source of the data. So data used can be false or modified.</li>
    <li>It shows misleading annotation for the Connecticut which gives misleading information.</li>
    <li>It doesn't provide the tooltip like visualization which would give better understanding even without considering colours but it doesn't provide tooltip as well.</li>
</ul>
